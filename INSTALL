HOWTO INSTALL
=============

If you got here it might be obvious you know you need PD to run this program
it was developed and tested using PD 0.37.0

Note that you need a dualhead (or TV-out) video card also capable for opening several
xv (XVideo eXtension) windows if you want to have the preview monitors
plus a second screen output to hook up to a beamer and get through to a BIG screen.


STEP 0 :: A) untar the tarball in your favorite location (/usr/local or /usr/local/patches/
             is recommended) and create a symlink to videoflow-XX where XX is the version.

             # tar xzvf videoflow-1.1.tgz
             # ln -s videoflow-1.1 videoflow

          B) cd to videoflow and follow the next steps

STEP 1 :: install all required dependencies

Required externals

* PDP (tested with 0.12.3)
* PiDiP (tested with 0.12.16)
* playlist
* Gem (scale and oneshot are used, at least)
* maxlib
* zexy

All of the above are critical for the patch to work.

Optional externals

* grid - nice for controlling some effects
* colorgrid - nice for picking colors in certain effects like the alpha blending (pdp_compose)
* countund - nice for some funny automatic effects
* OSC - nice for receiveing text input from a webform from the network
* fiddle~ - nice for some audio analysis for automatic video effects control
* linuxjoystick - nice for having joystick control for the effects and mix

It is recommended that you don't use a .pdrc file, but instead stick to the configuration
set in the videoflow.sh

STEP 2 :: Edit videoflow.sh shell script & fix your paths and stuff according to your system setup.

STEP 3 :: Run videoflow using the following command: ./scripts/videoflow.sh

if step 3 works, you can copy scripts/videoflow.sh to /usr/local/bin so that you can just type videoflow.sh on any console and the program will start

STEP 4 :: fix your paths to point to the directories where your movies live, and take control

STEP 5 :: choose a movie in channel A & B, and activate the video windows clicking the
          togglebox on the bottom-right side of the controls patch where reads: XV ON/OFF
	  NOTE that you should set your video windows to stay on top, and it is also
	  preferrable that you set their position automatically by clicking on the radio
	  box just below the XV ON/OFF switch

STEP 6 :: have a lot of fun !
